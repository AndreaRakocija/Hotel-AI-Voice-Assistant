# Hotel AI Voice Assistant

**A modern AI-powered voice and text assistant for hotel guests, built with React and OpenAI. Provides instant, conversational support and seamless human escalation.**

---

## Project Overview

Designed to enhance the guest experience, this AI assistant provides instant, conversational support for hotel-related inquiries. Guests can ask about rooms, packages, dining, or request special surprises, all through voice or text. When needed, it seamlessly escalates requests to human staff, ensuring a personal touch.

## Key Features

- **Voice & Text Interaction:** Speak naturally or type messages; powered by browser SpeechRecognition with a sleek chat interface.  
- **AI-Powered Answers:** Uses OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) for accurate, conversational responses.  
- **Human Escalation:** Detects requests for staff assistance and logs callbacks with timestamps.  
- **Speech Output:** Replies are read aloud using SpeechSynthesis.  
- **Modern, Responsive UI:** React + Tailwind CSS, chat bubbles, gradient buttons, interactive callback log.  
- **Context Awareness:** Maintains the last 10 messages for coherent multi-turn conversations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, SpeechRecognition, SpeechSynthesis  
- **AI Backend:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini)  
- **State Management:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

## Why It Stands Out

- Combines AI, voice interaction, and user-friendly UI to simulate a real concierge.  
- Demonstrates integration of AI APIs into a modern frontend.  
- Highlights problem-solving, UX design, and full-stack skills.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time room availability via backend APIs  
- Multi-language support  
- Persistent chat history in a database  
- Analytics dashboard for guest queries
